Good resources for learning and practicing reverse engineering:

- [[https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/][Online x86 and amd64 instruction reference]]
- [[https://www.xorpd.net/][xorpd's website]], specially his [[https://www.xorpd.net/pages/xchg_rax/snip_00.html][xchg rax, rax]] book, which you can read online
  for free.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversing:_Secrets_of_Reverse_Engineering][Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering]], by Eldad Eilam. Apart from RE, it's
  a great resource to learn about assembly, compiler optimizations, operating
  system design, and much more.
- [[https://challenges.re/][challenges.re]], has a lot of challenges with different difficulties.
