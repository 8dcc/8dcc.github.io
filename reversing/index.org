* External resources
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: external-resources
:END:

These are some good resources for learning and practicing reverse engineering.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversing:_Secrets_of_Reverse_Engineering][Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering]], by Eldad Eilam. Apart from RE, it's
  a great resource to learn about assembly, compiler optimizations, operating
  system design, and much more.
- Dennis Yurichev's [[https://challenges.re/][challenges.re]] website, which has a lot of interesting
  challenges with different difficulties.
- [[https://www.xorpd.net/][xorpd's website]].
- Félix Cloutier's [[https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/][x86 and amd64 instruction reference]]. In case the volume 2 of
  the Intel SDM is too intimidating.

* About the Intel SDM

:CUSTOM_ID: about-the-intel-sdm
:END:

Throughout this section, you might see some references to the /Intel Software
Developer Manual/ (Intel SDM). Since the volumes on the [[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html][official website]] are
regularly updated, you can read and download the specific version I used for the
references from the [[file:../reference/index.org][reference index]].
