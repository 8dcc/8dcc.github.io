* External resources

Good resources for learning and practicing reverse engineering:

- [[https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/][Online x86 and amd64 instruction reference]]
- [[https://www.xorpd.net/][xorpd's website]], specially his [[https://www.xorpd.net/pages/xchg_rax/snip_00.html][xchg rax, rax]] book, which you can read online
  for free.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversing:_Secrets_of_Reverse_Engineering][Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering]], by Eldad Eilam. Apart from RE, it's
  a great resource to learn about assembly, compiler optimizations, operating
  system design, and much more.
- [[https://challenges.re/][challenges.re]], has a lot of challenges with different difficulties.

* Intel manuals

Throughout this section, you might see some references to the *Intel Software
Developer Manual*. The manuals on the official website are regularly updated, so you can read and
download the specific version of the volumes I used for the references  from the
following links (See also, [[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html][Intel download page]]):

- Intel SDM, Volume 1: [[file:../manuals/intel-sdm-vol-1.pdf][253665-sdm-vol-1.pdf]]
- Intel SDM, Volume 2: [[file:../manuals/intel-sdm-vol-2abcd.pdf][325383-sdm-vol-2abcd.pdf]]
- Intel SDM, Volume 3: [[file:../manuals/intel-sdm-vol-3abcd.pdf][325384-sdm-vol-3abcd.pdf]]
- Intel SDM, Volume 4: [[file:../manuals/intel-sdm-vol-4.pdf][335592-sdm-vol-4.pdf]]
- AMD Manual: [[file:../manuals/amd-manual.pdf][24593.pdf]]

References to the manuals look something like:
