I will use this blog to post information in a more centralized way, instead of
spreading it across the wikis of the different projects.

Current sections:

- [[file:reversing/index.org][Reverse engineering]]

I will probably end up moving other documentations I have written for my
projects here, but until then, make sure you also check out:

- The [[https://github.com/fs-os/fs-os/wiki][fs-os wiki]], explaining the details of [[https://github.com/fs-os/fs-os][my operating system]].

My external links:

- [[https://github.com/8dcc][GitHub]]
- [[https://github.com/stars/8dcc/lists/my-dope-shit][List of my best repositories]]
- [[https://www.codewars.com/users/8dcc][Codewars profile]]

Feel free to [[https://github.com/8dcc/8dcc.github.io][contribute]] to this blog if you find any errors or if you have any
suggestions.
