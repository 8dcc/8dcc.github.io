I will use this blog to post information in a more centralized way, instead of
spreading it across the wikis of the different projects.

* Current sections

- [[file:reversing/index.org][Reverse engineering]]
- [[file:programming/index.org][Programming]]

* External documentations

I will probably end up moving other documentations I have written for my
projects here, but until then, make sure you also check out:

- The [[https://github.com/fs-os/fs-os/wiki][fs-os wiki]], explaining the details of [[https://github.com/fs-os/fs-os][my operating system]].
- [[https://github.com/8dcc/bms-cheat/wiki/Hooking-CreateMove][Hooking CreateMove]] in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)][source]] games.
- Finding the offsets and [[https://github.com/8dcc/tf2-cheat/wiki/Getting-SDL-offsets][hooking SDL functions]].
