I will use this blog to post information in a more centralized way, instead of
spreading it across the wikis of the different projects.

* Current sections

If you are interested in LaTeX, you might like these links too:

- The [[https://github.com/8dcc/scratch/tree/main/LaTeX][LaTeX folder]] inside my [[https://github.com/8dcc/scratch][scratch]] GitHub repository, has some other articles
  I have written, and also contains some of my [[https://github.com/8dcc/scratch/blob/main/LaTeX/math/math.pdf][math notes]].
- The [[https://github.com/8dcc/scratch][scratch]] repository itself is full of small but interesting projects in
  various languages. All the code is documented.

I will probably end up moving other documentations I have written for my
projects here, but until then, make sure to check out:

- The [[https://github.com/fs-os/fs-os/wiki][fs-os wiki]], explaining the details of [[https://github.com/fs-os/fs-os][my operating system]].
- [[https://github.com/8dcc/bms-cheat/wiki/Hooking-CreateMove][Hooking CreateMove]] in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)][source]] games.
- Finding the offsets and [[https://github.com/8dcc/tf2-cheat/wiki/Getting-SDL-offsets][hooking SDL functions]].
