I use this blog to post information in a more centralized way, rather than
writing articles across my different projects.

These are some articles that I have written across my different projects.

- The [[https://github.com/8dcc/scratch/tree/main/LaTeX][LaTeX folder]] inside my [[https://github.com/8dcc/scratch][scratch]] GitHub repository, has some other articles
  I have written, and also contains some of my [[https://github.com/8dcc/scratch/blob/main/LaTeX/math/math.pdf][math notes]].
- The [[https://github.com/8dcc/scratch][scratch]] repository itself is full of small but interesting projects in
  various languages. All the code is documented.
- The [[https://github.com/fs-os/fs-os/wiki][fs-os wiki]], explaining the details of [[https://github.com/fs-os/fs-os][my simple operating system]].
- [[https://github.com/8dcc/bms-cheat/wiki/Hooking-CreateMove][Hooking CreateMove]] in the Source 1 game engine.
- Finding offsets and [[https://github.com/8dcc/tf2-cheat/wiki/Getting-SDL-offsets][hooking SDL functions]].
