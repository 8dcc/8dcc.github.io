This article is about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)][monads]] in the context of programming, specifically about a
design pattern that is often used in purely functional languages, such as
[[https://www.haskell.org/][Haskell]]. This concept originates from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory][category theory]], but this article won't be
focusing on that.

Although I haven't personally used Haskell a lot, I have known about monads for
a long time, probably since I heard about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmonad][xmonad]] window manager. After
researching on this topic for a few days, I decided to write a small article
about what I learned, since it might be useful for some people. This article
won't focus specifically on Haskell, so most concepts can be applied to many
languages, and not a lot of programming background is required from the reader.
